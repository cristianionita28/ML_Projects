# Polynomial Regression – Visualization and Intuition

This repository contains a **didactic Jupyter Notebook** that demonstrates **Polynomial Regression**, with a strong focus on **visual intuition**, **model complexity**, and **overfitting vs underfitting**.

The notebook is designed for **teaching and learning purposes**, especially in courses related to:
- Statistics
- Machine Learning
- Data Science

---

## 📘 Contents

- `Polynomial Regression.ipynb`  
  Jupyter Notebook covering:
  - linear vs polynomial regression
  - feature expansion
  - effect of polynomial degree
  - visualization of fitted curves
  - intuition behind bias–variance tradeoff

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After going through this notebook, you should understand:
- why polynomial regression is still a **linear model**
- how polynomial degree affects model flexibility
- when increasing complexity leads to overfitting
- how visualization helps diagnose model behavior

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Notebook

You have **three easy options**.
