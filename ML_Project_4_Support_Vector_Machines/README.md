# Support Vector Classification (SVC) – Visualization

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating **Support Vector Classification (SVC)** with a focus on **visual intuition**.

The notebook illustrates:
- how SVC separates data using different kernels
- non-linear decision boundaries (RBF kernel)
- the role of **support vectors**
- model accuracy on the training data
