# Perceptron Algorithm with Visualization

This repository contains a **didactic and visual implementation of the Perceptron algorithm**, designed for teaching fundamental concepts in **machine learning, linear classification, and optimization**.

The notebook focuses on:
- understanding the Perceptron update rule
- visualizing decision boundaries
- building intuition for linear classifiers
