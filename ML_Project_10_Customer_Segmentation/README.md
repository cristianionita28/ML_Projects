# 🧠 Identify Customer Segments

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to **identify meaningful customer segments** using unsupervised machine learning.  
By analyzing demographic and behavioral features, we uncover **hidden patterns** that help businesses better understand and target their customers.

## ⚙️ Algorithms & Techniques Used

🔹 **Data Preprocessing**
- Missing value handling  
- Feature scaling (standardization)

🔹 **Dimensionality Reduction**
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**  
  → reduces noise and complexity while preserving key information

🔹 **Clustering**
- **K-Means Clustering**  
  → groups customers into homogeneous segments based on similarity

🔹 **Evaluation & Interpretation**
- Explained variance (PCA)
- Cluster centroids analysis
- Visual inspection of segments

## 📊 What the Model Does
✔️ Transforms high-dimensional customer data  
✔️ Compresses it into meaningful components  
✔️ Automatically discovers customer groups  
✔️ Highlights structural differences between segments

---

## 🧩 Key Conclusion

🚀 The analysis reveals **distinct customer segments** with clearly different profiles.  
These segments can be used for:
- Personalized marketing
- Customer targeting
- Product strategy
- Data-driven business decisions

**Unsupervised learning proves powerful** for discovering structure where no labels exist.
